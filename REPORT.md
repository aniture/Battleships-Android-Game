## Summary and Reflection


In this project, Initially, For data management and UI design, I leveraged Flutter's widget library extensively, allowing for efficient and visually appealing interfaces across different devices. I also prioritized responsive design principles to ensure optimal performance on various screen sizes and orientations.
Additionally, while the feature engineering process was quite extensive, I think there's room for improvement, especially in creating more meaningful interaction terms. Overall, I'm pleased with the results, but there's definitely more to explore and refine.
I ran into some configuration issues that I couldn’t resolve in time. Despite this, the local testing showed promising results. To further evaluate my work, I think focusing on optimizing the hyperparameters and possibly incorporating more advanced techniques like ensemble learning could yield even better outcomes.


The instant feedback loop was definitely a high point for me—it made designing the app much more interactive and fun.
Overall, I enjoyed working on the project's outcomes, although I encountered configuration issues that persisted until the end. Despite these setbacks, local testing yielded promising results. To enhance the evaluation of my work, considering advanced techniques like ensemble learning could further elevate the project's effectiveness and robustness.
